# Trimmer
## Introduction
Trimmer is an add-on for Blender. Its goal is to simplify the process of mapping an existing trim-sheet to a model. The basic workflow is: 
- Preliminary: creating a plane divided into faces that reference the positions of trims on the trimsheet
- Adding the trim locations to the add-on panel
- Applying a trim to a selected face or faces
- Rotating and reflecting the applied trim if necessary

## Installation
Download the latest release of Trimmer from [the github page](https://github.com/LaXHeXLuX/Trimmer/releases).
In Blender 2.80 or later, go to *Edit* → *Preferences* → *Add-ons* → *Install from Disk*. Browse to the downloaded zip file, select it, and **Install from Disk**.

The add-on can now be found in *Edit* → *Preferences* → *Add-ons*, where it can be enabled, disabled, or uninstalled.
